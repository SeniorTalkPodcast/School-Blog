        <p>Ease of distraction at home can hinder concentration and academic performance. Internet connection problems, both at home and at school, can disrupt the flow of the class and make active participation difficult. In addition, a lack of communication and attention from some teachers leaves us feeling disconnected and unsupported. Insufficient explanation of topics can lead to confusion and difficulties in understanding the concepts presented. Finally, teachers' tardiness in joining meetings generates frustration and delays our learning progress.</p>

        <p>Online classes can present internet connection problems, both on the part of the student and the educational institution, which can affect the quality of learning and lead to delays in the delivery of assignments. In addition, certain practical or interactive activities are exclusive to face-to-face classes, which limits the learning experiences of online students. The lack of face-to-face interaction can hinder the development of social relationships and active participation in the classroom, which can make some students feel more shy or disconnected. Finally, excessive screen time can have negative health consequences, such as eyestrain and sedentary lifestyles, raising concerns about the overall well-being of online learners.</p>

        <p>Some students may struggle because they do not have face-to-face interactions with their teachers and peers, which may hinder their engagement and understanding of the subject. Similarly, variables such as the digital divide or distractions at home can have a negative impact on the online learning experience. </p>

        <p> Being online such as less comunicación with my peers and it's harder to build relationships being isolated, another issue is the internet at school so the teachers can't get into the class, as well as some of them who simply just assign the work and don't necessarily teach. Another con that can be seen is lack of communication between students and staff, with being up to date with announcements and events</p>

        <p>The Internet it is quite difficult to have classes fluently since the teacher's camera tends to be very blurry as well as the explanation, it is very laggy and the sound is choppy which prevents us from understanding clearly. Some teachers do not connect to classes or do not give clear instructions. It is difficult for us to ask our questions due to Internet problems or because some teachers do not pay us the same attention as those in person.</p>
